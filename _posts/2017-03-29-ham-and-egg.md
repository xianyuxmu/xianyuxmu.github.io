这是一个商业方面的寓言(business fable)，下面是来自 [***The Chicken and the Pig***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig) 的摘要：

``` 
A Pig and a Chicken are walking down the road.
The Chicken says: "Hey Pig, I was thinking we should open a restaurant!"
Pig replies: "Hm, maybe, what would we call it?"
The Chicken responds: "How about 'ham-n-eggs'?"
The Pig thinks for a moment and says: "No thanks. I'd be committed, but you'd only be involved."
```

由此引出一个问题：

```
Question: In a bacon-and-egg breakfast, what's the difference between the Chicken and the Pig?
Answer: The Chicken is involved, but the Pig is committed!
```
