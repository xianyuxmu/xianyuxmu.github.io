## General

- My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn't have something, he would disappointed. It changed my mindset st an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. Don't be afraid to fail. - *Sara Blakely*
- As soon as I stopped trying to think about a business idea and started focusing on what I'm passionate about, that's when it came to me. - *Nick woodman, Founder of GoPro*

## Michelangelo

Wikipedia：[Michelangelo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo)

- I was never the kind of painter or sculptor who kept a shop.
	- 你的人生是要每天坐在办公室里么？
- If people knew how hard I had to work to gain my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all.
	- 成功很简单，两个字：努力。
- Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.
	- 你的伯乐在哪呢？
- Lord, grant that I may always desire more than I can accomplish.
	- you want, you get.
- The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.
	- 我们多数人的危机不在于把目标设置得太高而没能达成，而是把目标设得太低而达成了。
- Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.
	- 细节成就完美，完美不是细节。
- What do you despise? By this you are truly known.
	- 你会鄙视已知的，对未知的充满期待。
