	- 最危险的时刻是胜利的时刻。
- At the beginning of a campaign it is important to consider whether or not to move forward; but when one has taken the offensive it is necessary to maintain it to the last extremity. However skilfully effected a retreat may be, it always lessens the morale of an army, since in losing the chances of success, they are remitted to the enemy. A retreat, moreover, costs much more in men and materials than the bloodiest engagements, with this difference, also, that in a battle the enemy loses practically as much as you do; while in a retreat you lose and he does not.
	- 在战役开始时，考虑是否向前推进很重要，但是当进攻进行到最后时，必须把它保持在最后一个极端。不管撤退多么巧妙，它总是会降低军队的士气，因为一旦失去成功的机会，就会被交还给敌人。此外，撤退比最血腥的战斗花费更多的人力和物力，还有一个差别，在战斗中敌人实际上损失和你一样多，而在撤退中你损失而不是他。

- Surely in a matter of this kind we should endeavor to do something, that we may say that we have not lived in vain, that we may leave some impress of ourselves on the sands of time.
	- 我们应当努力奋斗，有所作为。这样，我们就可以说，我们没有虚度年华，并有可能在时间的沙滩上留下我们的足迹。
