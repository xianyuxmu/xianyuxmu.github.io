## 什么是类比？

Analogy is an important way of thinking.

A person sees something new, and thinks 'what is it'? 

Then he might think, 'Ah, it's like something I have seen before...' 

So an analogy is a comparison between two things which we think are similar in some way. 

We compare two things, or two systems, and think they have something important in common.

Definition from [Analogy](https://literarydevices.net/analogy/)

An analogy is a comparison in which an idea or a thing is compared to another thing that is quite different from it. It aims at explaining that idea or thing by comparing it to something that is familiar. Metaphors and similes are tools used to draw an analogy. Therefore, analogy is more extensive and elaborate than either a simile or a metaphor. Consider the following example:

> “The structure of an atom is like a solar system. The nucleus is the sun, and electrons are the planets revolving around their sun.”

Examples of Analogy:

* Life is like a race. The one who keeps running wins the race, and the one who stops to catch a breath loses.
* Just as a sword is the weapon of a warrior, a pen is the weapon of a writer.
* How a doctor diagnoses diseases is like how a detective investigates crimes.
* Just as a caterpillar comes out of its cocoon, so we must come out of our comfort zone.
* You are as annoying as nails on a chalkboard.

类比，或类推，是一种认识过程，通过将某个特定事物所附带的信息转移到其他特定的事物之上的一个过程。类比是人类思考方式中的一种重要途径，可以用于辨别问题、解释概念、及发现新的事物或功能。

“类比思维”方法是解决陌生问题的一种常用策略。它让我们充分开拓自己的思路，运用已有的知识、经验将陌生的、不熟悉的问题与已经解决了的熟悉的问题或其他相似事物进行类比，从而创造性地解决问题。
