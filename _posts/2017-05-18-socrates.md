</blockquote>

- Be as you wish to seem.
- Beauty is a short-lived tyranny.
- I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing.
- It is not living that matters, but living rightly.
- Not life, but good life, is to be chiefly valued.
- The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear.
- Wisdom begins in wonder.
- By all means marry. If you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher and that is a good thing for any man.
- An hoest man is always a child.
- Beware the barrenness of a busy life.
- The unexamined life is not worth living.
- ***The greatest way to live with honor in this world is to be what we pretend to be.***
- Worthless people live only to eat and drink; people of worth eat and drink only to live.
