## Do you have what it takes?

- There is no worse feeling than being trapped in a job you do not enjoy. 
- To be a success the most important thing is to love what you do.
- Find a way to turn the "no" into a "yes". Do not let anybody stop you!
- Hire the best people, and don't trust them.
- I walked in at 1:00, exactly when Sharon walked in, and the maitre d' hugded me--he was almost overdoing it--and he said, "Mr. Zanker, nice to see you." He ushered us to a great table. Sharon was duly impressed.
- "No" was not an option. The most successful people I have learned from **just never take no for an answer.**


## Passion, Passion, Passion!


- You can's just sit around waiting for deals, opportunities, or a lucky break.
- Sure, you need to get paid for your work, and you will if you provide something valuable. In the game of life, money is how you score.
- Broaden your vision to see the total picture of what you are offering.
- To be done right, every job require passion.
- Without passion, life lacks luster.
- Passion is more important than brains or talent.
