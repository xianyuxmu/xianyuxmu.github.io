## Intro

### What is SOA?

[SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)， *Service-oriented architecture*，中文叫做 **面向服务的体系结构**。

> SOA is a style of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network.  - Wikipedia

[Principles of SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture#Principles)

For more detail, please visiting Wikipedia directly!

### What is Microservices?

[**Microservices**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) is a specialisation of an implementation approach for service-oriented architectures (SOA) used to build flexible, independently deployable software systems.

Services in a microservice architecture (**MSA**) are processes that communicate with each other over a network in order to fulfill a goal.

## Why SOA & MSA?

Benefited from their own features, SOA & MSA are widely used in many scenarios of nowadays software developing.

SOA & MSA are just design patterns, the principles we could use when designing software architecture or refactoring.

Everything has its advantages, well its disadvantages, those called its feature of design.

Our businesses are changing faster and faster nowadays, softwares are becoming massive and going out of control. MSA's concepts helps us building a progressive development to make our softwares scalable and keep pace with fast growing business' requirements!
