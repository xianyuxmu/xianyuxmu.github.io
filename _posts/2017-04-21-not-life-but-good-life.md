### Learning These 9 Tough Skills Will Immediately Improve Your Entire Life


### Thinking of your time as money

Time is one of our few non-renewable resources — we only have a finite amount of it every day. 

### Scheduling your energy

With social media screaming at us from our phones, tablets, and laptops all day, it’s difficult to filter out the noise and actually achieve what we’ve set out to do.

### Networking

“Remember, people do business with people they know, like, and trust.”

### Getting started early

Yep, it’s true that almost every highly successful person tends to wake up at around 5 AM.

Planning everything in advance. Life is limited, you must focus on the most important.

### Setting short goals

Both short-term and long-term goal setting is a vital skill that keeps you focused on achieving success.

### Meditating and winding down

It might seem surprising that getting skilled at not working (or even thinking) can result in more success. 

### Active Listening

Instead of nodding off, consider both showing the speaker that you’re interested (nodding, agreeing, etc.) and actually making an effort to understand (by asking questions and clarifying). 

### Eliminating ANTS(automatic negative thoughts)

Negative thoughts happen to everyone, but the worst thing you can do is let them rattle around in your brain and drag your day down.

## Money, Health, Family— 10 rules to live by from the times of Socrates to Modern day

### Move on

> If you do not step forward you will always remain where you are — Nora Roberts

**The rule**: Never linger on the past. Spending time wondering what could have happened differently. When something happens, move on to the next chapter.

Sh*t happens.

### Where possible, delegate and give away

> Your home is living space, not storage space― Francine Jay

**The rule**: Let go. Money, memories, power, possessions.

No one is indispensable. Things will happen even if you are not there.

### Take ownership

> In the long run, we shape our lives, and we shape ourselves. The process never ends until we die. And the choices we make are ultimately our own responsibility — Eleanor Roosevelt

**The rule**: Being responsible for all my actions and whatever happens to me.

No one is responsible for our life but us. When evil happens, no one else is responsible. When things go well, we make it happen. No one else.

### Be open

> A good traveler is one who knows how to travel with the mind — Michael Bassey Johnson

**The rule**: Be open to experiences and experiments. Always be curious.

New places, new thoughts, new people, new exercise regimes, new projects.

### Say No

> The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything — Warren Buffet

**The rule**: Saying no to requests unless I am certain.

I picked this up later in life. I used to say Yes a lot. Ended up taking too many projects. Accepted too many invites. And later regretted it.

> ### Simplify

> Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated — Confucius

**The rule**: Do not overthink problems.

I have learned overthinking does not help solve problems. Most of the challenges we face in life are simpler than we tend to make it.

Make life simpler. Stop overanalysing.

### Make decisions, quickly

> Are you sure, Gray?’
He lifted his eyes. ‘No . . . I’m not. I’m not sure of a damn thing.’ He slipped his hands free of the monsignor’s and peeled the battery off the phone, cutting the last ring in half. ‘But that doesn’t mean I won’t act― James Rollins, The Judas Strain

**The rule**: Do not think too much when making daily decisions. If you are making life changing decisions, sleep over it for a night.

I make decisions quickly. I have realized most of the decisions 

I make do not have a long-term impact. Also, I never will have all the information. And there will always be factors beyond our control.

### Don’t hide

> Fear is only as deep as the mind allows — Japanese Proverb

**The rule**: Don’t hide behind fears. Face challenges heads on.

I have learned this rule over time and at a very high cost. 

Hiding behind fears do not make the problem go away. It only makes the problem worse.

### Put Family/Loved ones first

> All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way— Leo Tolstoy

**The rule**: Family/Loved ones come first. No questions.

We tend to take our loved ones for granted. We get too busy with our career and start sacrificing on the family time.

Assuming they will always be there.

Children grow up too quickly. The loved ones may not be there when you need her most. Take care of them.

### Don’t make your money work too hard

> The quickest way to double your money is to fold it in half and put it in your back pocket — Will Rogers

**The rule**: Spend less than you earn. Save. Invest wisely. Use compound interest.

We are constantly bombarded with different ways to make a fortune. There is no easy way. The only way build wealth is to work wisely.

Don’t invest unless you know all the rules and understand risks.
