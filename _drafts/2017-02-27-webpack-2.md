[webpack 2](https://webpack.js.org/) 

- 

[Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/) - A next-generation ES6 module bundler, cliking link ahead the line to see the demos.

- **Tree-shaking** - Including the code you actually need, eliminating unused library code with tree-shaking. The resulting bundle size <= other tools'.
- Use via JavaScript API or a Command Line Interface.
- Plugin
- Start from entry file, then recursively imports until whole library in a single file.

### 评价

- Well design with ES6's new feature([bindings](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Bindings) and [cycles](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/Cycles)). Bundling the app or library using ES2015 and reducing bundling size with tree-shaking.
- Configurations are more easily. 

``` javascript
import json from 'rollup-plugin-json';
import babel from 'rollup-plugin-babel';
import nodeResolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve';
import less from 'rollup-plugin-less';

export default {
  entry: 'client/app/operation/app.js',
  format: 'umd',
  plugins: [ json(), babel({ 
	runtimeHelpers: true,
	exclude: "node_modules/**",
    presets: ['es2015-rollup', 'stage-0']
   }),
  nodeResolve(),
  less()
   ],
  dest: 'bundle.js', // equivalent to --output
  external: [ 'moment' ]
};

```

and run `rollup -c` to start bundling! That's easy!

- Fading in trend and its designing long lasts. Still in developing with no stable version, and webpack 2 has been implementing its feature. The trend is going down in Github while webpack 2 going up.
- It's one of our dreams, now we wake up and implement it in webpack 2. Years go by, Rollup is another Browserify.

## webpack 2 Documentation

### Entry and Context

- The **entry** object is where webpack looks to start building the bundle. The current directory is used by default.
- The **context** is an absolute string to the directory that contains the entry files. At this point the application starts executing. If an array is passed all items will be executed.

### Output

The top-level ***output*** key contains set of options instructing webpack on how and where it should output your bundles, assets and anything else you bundle or load with webpack.

> Only used when `target` is web, which uses JSONP for loading on-demand chunks, by adding script tags.


### Module

These options determine how the different types of modules within a project will be treated.

### Rule

A `Rule` can be separated into three parts — Conditions, Results and nested Rules.

There are two input values for the conditions:

- **The resource:** An absolute path to the file requested. It's already resolved according the resolve rules.
- **The issuer:** An absolute path to the file of the module which requested the resource. It's the location of the import.

**Example:** When we import "./style.css" from app.js, the resource is /path/to/style.css and the issuer is /path/to/app.js.

### Resolve

These options change how modules are resolved.

### Plugins


### Externals

`externals` configuration in webpack provides a way of not including a dependency in the bundle. 

### Module Resolution

A resolver is a library which helps in locating a module by its absolute path. 

### Loaders

webpack enables use of loaders to preprocess files. This allows you to bundle any static resource way beyond JavaScript. You can easily write your own loaders using Node.js.
